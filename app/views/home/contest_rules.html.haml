    %p.title About Music Mogul
    %p Music Mogul strives to become the online community where music fans collaborate to discover and launch tomorrow’s star singers, bands, and producers.
    %p Our vision is to evolve Music Mogul into an online and mobile game, based on high-stakes, multi-week talent contests. Fans will earn points, recognition, and prizes for judging, discovering, and promoting the contestants. Musicians will get opportunities to perform, meet new fans, and earn prizes and cash as they advance through the contests. Ultimately, we want to create groundswells that bring national press and music industry attention to the musicians and fans who win our contests.
    %p This is the first Music Mogul contest. It’s a limited version of our vision that’s designed to introduce Music Mogul and to get market feedback (make a suggestion or email us). If musicians and fans like the concept, we’ll run more contests with additional features and larger prize pools.

    %p.title Rules For Moguls (music fans)
    %ol
      %li Sign up and complete your profile.
      %li Invite up to 5 friends to help judge the contest. You get 2,500 points for each Mogul who registers using your referral link. The contest is invite-only and we’re looking for Moguls who are enthusiastic about music and giving their opinion on it. The larger the community, the more prizes we’ll be able to bring in, and the more exciting the contest will be for everyone. You can find your referral link on the Home or My Friends page.
      %li Audition the contestants. You get 1,000 points for each audition you complete. Watch and then evaluate the music videos based on the music, vocals, and presentation. You can find your evaluation queue on the Auditions page.
      %li Sign the 5 contestants you think are the best. You get the sum of the points earned by the contestants you sign. You’ll earn more than 50% of your points from your signees, so sign carefully! You can sign contestants after you Audition them, or on the My Evaluations page.
      %li Follow your standing in the contest using your personal scorecard (at the top of the My Evaluations page). Expand (click the bottom of) your scorecard to see the breakdown of points you’ve earned from invitees, auditions, and signees (the contestants you’ve signed).
      %li Check your inbox for contest updates.
      %li Check the Contestant and Mogul Leader Boards, which we’ll turn on after judging ends on 3/24/13 to see how you and the contestants you signed did in the contest.
      %li The 25 Moguls with the highest scores will earn prizes. We have a $500 budget for the Mogul prizes, but need your help determining what those prizes are! The purpose of the prizes is to show appreciation to the Moguls for their time and effort, but we don’t think cash prizes are appropriate or sustainable for Moguls. If you have a creative idea for prizes that will be meaningful to Moguls, we’d love your input through a suggestion or email!
